# Wavecon Telecom 5G Analysis
## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Codebasics Virtual Internship with AtliQ Technologies.
The goal was to analyze the impact of the 5G launch on Wavecon Telecomâ€™s business performance across revenue, customers, and plan subscriptions.

## Key Focus Areas

Tracking revenue trends before and after the 5G launch

Identifying underperforming KPIs

Analyzing plan-wise performance (top and bottom performing packs)

Evaluating significantly impacted plans (continue or discontinue)

Understanding reasons behind discontinued plans

## Dashboards

The analysis was presented using interactive Power BI dashboards. Below are the main views:

### Home Page

Key metrics: Revenue, ARPU, Total Active Users, and Unsubscribed Users.

Overall impact of 5G on revenue and customer base.

### Market Insights

City-wise performance after 5G rollout.

Market share comparison with competitors.

Top and bottom 5 cities based on ARPU.

### Plan Analysis

Revenue performance of individual plans.

Identification of top-performing and discontinued plans.

### Key Metrics Dashboard

Monthly average revenue before and after 5G.

Trend analysis and city-level performance.

## Insights & Recommendations

Revenue slightly declined (-0.50%) post 5G launch, especially in metro cities.

Active user base decreased by 8.28%, while unsubscribed users increased.

Several short-validity and low-data plans (e.g., P8, P9, P10) were discontinued due to changing customer needs in the 5G era.

Tier-2 cities (e.g., Lucknow, Patna, Coimbatore) showed stronger adoption compared to metros.

Recommendation: Focus on data-heavy, longer-validity plans that align with 5G usage.

## Learnings

This project gave me hands-on experience in:

Business problem solving

Storytelling with data

Using Power BI for visualization and insights

Presenting findings in a structured format
